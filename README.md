this repository is a playground for using ai agent tooling for various projects

ideally first i will implement an agent to ping a locally hosted API that returns a 200 and some text. 

then i will create a docker compose and setup scripts for both the agent AND server. 

likely there will be a .env required in the root, i will include a `.env-example` for a person to populate as they see fit
