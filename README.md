this repository is a playground for using ai agent tooling for various projects (requirements will be contained per-subfolder app to keep it simple, create virtual environments as you see fit)

ideally first i will implement an agent to ping a locally hosted API that returns a 200 and some text. 

then i will create a docker compose and setup scripts for both the agent AND server. 

likely there will be a .env required in the root, i will include a `.env-example` for a person to populate as they see fit

looking at the [anthropic cookbook](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook/tree/main)

as a starting point for local agents
