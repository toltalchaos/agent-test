## ESP32 Controller Interface: Instructions & Code

This section provides comprehensive instructions and code for building an ESP32-based controller designed to interface with our APIs. By following these steps, you will assemble the hardware, upload the firmware, and verify connectivity with the backend Flask API.

### Project Goals

- Assemble an ESP32 module with a speaker, microphone, LED, and button.
- Upload and configure the provided firmware to enable OTA (Over-The-Air) updates and hardware interaction.
- Test the setup by triggering API requests and receiving visual feedback via the LED.

### 1. Hardware Assembly

**Required Components:**
- ESP32 development board
- Push button
- LED (with appropriate resistor)
- Microphone module (e.g., MAX9814)
- Speaker (compatible with ESP32 output)
- Jumper wires and breadboard (or soldering tools)

**Instructions:**
1. **Connect the Button:**  
    - Wire one side of the button to a digital GPIO pin (e.g., GPIO 0) and the other to ground.
2. **Connect the LED:**  
    - Connect the LED anode to a GPIO pin (e.g., GPIO 2) through a resistor (220Ω recommended), and the cathode to ground.
3. **Attach the Microphone:**  
    - Connect the microphone module’s output to an analog input pin (e.g., GPIO 34), and supply power (3.3V and GND).
4. **Attach the Speaker:**  
    - Connect the speaker to a suitable output pin (e.g., via a simple amplifier circuit if needed), and ground.

### 2. Firmware Upload

**Steps:**
1. Install [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) or [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/).
2. Add the ESP32 board support via the Boards Manager.
3. Download the provided firmware from this repository.
4. Open the firmware project in your IDE.
5. Connect the ESP32 to your computer via USB.
6. Select the correct board and port in your IDE.
7. Upload the code to the ESP32.

### 3. Firmware Overview

The provided code will:
- Initialize the ESP32 hardware (button, LED, microphone, speaker).
- Enable OTA updates for easy future firmware changes.
- Listen for button presses and send HTTP requests to the Flask API.
- Blink the LED to indicate successful API communication.
- Optionally, play a sound via the speaker or record audio with the microphone for future features.

### 4. Testing & Verification

1. **Start the Flask API server** as described in the backend documentation.
2. **Press the button** on the ESP32 module.
3. **Observe the following:**
    - The ESP32 sends a request to the Flask API.
    - The API responds with HTTP 200 and logs a confirmation message in the terminal.
    - The ESP32 blinks its LED several times to confirm successful connectivity.
    - (Optional) The speaker may emit a sound to indicate success.
